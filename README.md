# Data Structures and Algorithms in Ruby

In order to best understand how each data structure and algorithm works I have implemented them in Ruby. These should not be used for anything real.

### Data Structures
- [x] Linked List
- [x] Stack
- [ ] Queue - empty?, peek, add, remove.
- [ ] Binary Search Tree
  - [ ] Preorder Traversal
  - [ ] Inorder Traversal
  - [ ] Postorder Traversal
- [ ] Hash Table
- [ ] Heap

### Algorithms

#### Sort
- [ ] Merge Sort
- [ ] Quick Sort

#### Search
- [ ] Binary Search
- [ ] Depth-First Search
- [ ] Breadth-First Search
